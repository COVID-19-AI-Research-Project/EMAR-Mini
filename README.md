# Introduction

**EMAR Mini** is a minature version of EMAR, an open-source Emergency Robot Assistant to assist doctors, nurses and hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar situations we may face in the future.

The idea for this open-source tele-operated robot came as I was sat in room in a hospital surrounded by people with COVID-19 as a potential COVID-19 Pneumonia patient. The doctors, nurses and other teams were in among us for the whole 12 hours or more I was in the hospital.

Some of the common things I saw was nurses & doctors calling patients, giving paracetamol, taking temperatures, adjusting masks and blankets. Every time one of the medical staff had to do one of these tasks they were putting themselves in danger of catching COVID-19.

Each of these tasks can be carried out by tele-operated robots, so this is where the idea came from.   

EMAR Mini will be our official demonstration robot as it is smaller and more portable, though has obvious restrictions compared to EMAR. 

__This project is a work in progress, however our plan is to work with a local medical/health center or hospital to do a pilot project with EMAR (Large).__

# Key Features

- **HIAS Network Device**
    - EMAR is a device on the HIAS network, allowing machine to machine/machine to application communication.
- **HIAS UI Plugin**
    - Integration with the HIAS UI.
- **3D printed**
    - EMAR's shell is 3D printed.
- **Tele-Operated** 
    - Remotely operated using the HIAS UI & voice control.
- **Realtime Camera Stream** 
    - Streams local camera frames to a local server, used by HIAS to allow users to see where they are navigating EMAR Mini.
- **Two way audio streaming** 
    - Two way audio streaming allows medical staff and patients to communicate.
- **Realtime Depth Sensing** 
    - Uses Intel Realsense D415 camera and streams depth frames to a local server, used by HIAS to allow users to see realtime stream of depth sensors.
- **Realtime Temperature Sensing** 
    - Uses thermal camera to take temperature readings of patients.

&nbsp;

# Assistance Features
