# Prerequisites  

## HIAS Sever
This system requires a fully functioning [HIAS server](https://github.com/LeukemiaAiResearch/HIAS "HIAS server"). Follow the [HIAS server installation guide](https://github.com/LeukemiaAiResearch/HIAS/blob/master/Documentation/Installation/Installation.md "HIAS server installation guide") to setup your HIAS server before continuing with this tutorial.

## Device 1 & 2 Installation Guides
Before you continue with this tutorial, you should complete the steps in the [Device 1](Devices/1/Documentation/Installation/Installation.md "Device 1") & [Device 2](Devices/2/Documentation/Installation/Installation.md "Device 2") installation guides.

## Ubuntu Server 18.04.4 LTS
For this project, the operating system of choice is [Ubuntu Server 18.04.4 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/server "Ubuntu Server 18.04.4 LTS"). To get your operating system installed you can follow the [Create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#0 "Create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu") tutorial. 

**__!! The server installation REQUIRES a fresh installation, do not do this on an existing system, if you make a mistake you will have to reinstall and will lose all of the contents of your device !!__**

## Ubuntu kernel 4.15.0 for UP
To be able to interact with the pins of the UP2 you need to install the UP kernel. When it asks you if you want to abort, you need to choose **no** and continue the installation.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubilinux/up
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge 'linux-.*generic'
sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-hwe-18.04-upboard
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

## Clone the repository
Clone the [EMAR](https://github.com/COVID-19-Research-Project/EMAR-Mini "EMAR") repository from the [Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project "Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research") Github Organization.

To clone the repository and install EMAR-Mini, make sure you have Git installed. Now to the home directory on your server device using terminal/commandline, and then use the following command.

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/COVID-19-Research-Project/EMAR-Mini.git
```

Once you have used the command above you will see a directory called **EMAR-Mini** in your home directory. 
```
ls
```
Using the ls command in your home directory should show you the following.
```
EMAR-Mini
```
Navigate to **EMAR-Mini/Devices/2** directory, this is your project root directory for this tutorial.

### Developer Forks
Developers from the Github community that would like to contribute to the development of this project should first create a fork, and clone that repository. For detailed information please view the [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md "CONTRIBUTING") guide. You should pull the latest code from the development branch.

```
  $ git clone -b "0.3.0" https://github.com/COVID-19-Research-Project/EMAR-Mini.git
```

The **-b "0.3.0"** parameter ensures you get the code from the latest master branch. Before using the below command please check our latest master branch in the button at the top of the project README.

&nbsp;

# Installation
Now you need to install the EMAR system and it's dependencies.

## Update Device Settings

Now you need to update the device 3 settings using the credentials provided in the HIAS UI. 

```
sudo nano Device/3/confs.json
```
```
{
    "iotJumpWay": {
        "host": "YourHiasServerURL",
        "port": 8883,
        "ip": "localhost",
        "lid": 0,
        "zid": 0,
        "did": 0,
        "dn": "YourEmarDevice3Name",
        "un": "YourEmarDevice3Username",
        "pw": "YourEmarDevice3Password"
    },
    "EMAR": {
        "ip": "YourEmarDevice3LocalIP"
    },
    "TASS": {
        "server": {
            "port": 8080
        },
        "socket": {
            "port": 8181
        },
        "vid": 0
    }
}
```

## Device Security
First you will harden your device security. 

### Remote User
You will create a new user for accessing your server remotely. Use the following commands to set up a new user for your machine. Follow the instructions provided and make sure you use a secure password.
```
sudo adduser YourUsername 
```
Now grant sudo priveleges to the user:
```
usermod -aG sudo YourUsername
```
Now open a new terminal and login to your server using the new credentials you set up.
```
ssh YourNewUser@YourServerIP
```

### SSH Access
Now let's beef up server secuirty. Use the following command to set up your public and private keys. Make sure you carry out this step on your development machine, **not** on your server.

#### Tips
- Hit enter to confirm the default file. 
- Hit enter twice to skip the password (Optionalm, you can use a password if you like).
```
ssh-keygen
```
You should end up with a screen like this:
```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/genisys/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/genisys/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/genisys/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:5BYJMomxATmanduT3/d1CPKaFm+pGEIqpJJ5Z3zXCPM genisys@genisyslprt
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|.oooo..          |
|o .o.o . .       |
|.+..    +        |
|o o    o .       |
|  .o .+ S . .    |
| =..+o = o.o . . |
|= o =oo.E .o..o .|
|.. + ..o.ooo+. . |
|        .o++.    |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```
Now you are going to copy your key to the server: 
```
ssh-copy-id YourNewUser@YourServerIP
```
Once you enter your password for the new user account, your key will be saved on the server. Now try and login to the server again in a new terminal, you should log straight in without having to enter a password.
```
ssh YourNewUser@YourServerIP
```
Finally you will turn off password authentication for login. Use the following command to edit the ssh configuration.
```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Change the following:
```
#PasswordAuthentication yes
```
To:
```
PasswordAuthentication no
```
Then restart ssh:
```
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
_If you are using ssh to do the above steps keep your current terminal connected._ Open a new terminal, attempt to login to your server. If you can login then the above steps were successful. 

The remainder of this tutorial assumes you are logged into your device. From your development machine, connect to your device using ssh or open your local terminal if working directly on the machine.

```
ssh YourUser@YourServerIP
```
### UFW Firewall
Now you will set up your firewall:

```
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw disable
```
Now open the required ports, these ports will be open on your server, but are not open to the outside world:
```
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
```
Finally start and check the status:
```
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```
You should see the following:
```
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
22 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

### Fail2Ban
Fail2Ban adds an additional layer of security, by scanning server logs and looking for unusal activity. Fail2Ban is configured to work with IPTables by default, so we will do some reconfiguration to make it work with our firewall, UFW.

```
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo mv /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo rm /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf
sudo touch /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf
echo "[Definition]" | sudo tee -a /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf
echo "  enabled  = true" | sudo tee -a /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf
echo "  actionstart =" | sudo tee -a /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf
echo "  actionstop =" | sudo tee -a /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf
echo "  actioncheck =" | sudo tee -a /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf
echo "  actionban = ufw insert 1 deny from <ip> to any" | sudo tee -a /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf
echo "  actionunban = ufw delete deny from <ip> to any" | sudo tee -a /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf
sudo sed -i -- "s#banaction = iptables-multiport#banaction = ufw#g" /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo fail2ban-client restart
sudo fail2ban-client status
```
You should see the following:
```
Shutdown successful
Server ready
```
```
Status
|- Number of jail:      1
`- Jail list:   sshd
```

## Python Dependencies

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install python3-opencv
sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt
sudo pip3 install Pillow
sudo pip3 install numpy
sudo pip3 install zmq
sudo pip3 install psutil
```

## MRAA
We will communicate with the pins of the UP2 using GPIO.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mraa/mraa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libmraa2 libmraa-dev libmraa-java python-mraa python3-mraa node-mraa mraa-tools
sudo apt-get install libupm-dev libupm-java python-upm python3-upm node-upm upm-examples
sudo apt install i2c-tools
sudo apt install upboard-extras
```

## Jumper Wires
You can use any color wires, in this tutorial we use the following color map:

- RED: VCC (Power)
- WHITE: Ground
- GREEN: GPIO

## Breadboard
![Breadboard](../../../../Media/Images/breadboard.jpg)
We will use a breadboard for our circuit, at this point in development this breadboard is used only for a power on LED and a communication LED that flashes when the device receives data from the iotJumpWay.

### UP2 Pinout

### RPI GP-Bus Layout
![UP2 RPI GP-Bus Layout](../../../../Media/Images/up2-rpi-pinout.png)
[Source](https://up-board.org/upsquared/specifications/ "Source")  

### LEDs
First of all we wil add the power and ground jumper wires. Connect a jumper wire to pin 1 on the UP2 and then connect the other end to the power rail of the breadboard. Then connect a wire to pin 6 and connect the other end to the ground rail on your breadboard.

Place the 2 LEDs on your breadboard as shown in the image above. Attach the long legs of the LEDs to the resistors, and the other leg of the resistors to the power rail on the breadboard.

The LED on the far left is the power LED, this will flash on startup and remain lit whilst the program is running. Connect a wire to pin 15, and the other end connect to the short leg of the power LED. 

The other LED is the communication LED, this will light up when the device receives a command from the iotJumpWay. Connect a wire to pin 13, and the other end connect to the short leg of the communication LED. 

## Robotic Arm
![Robotic Arm](../../../../Media/Images/arm.jpg)

For this version of the robot you will use the [6 DOF Robot Manipulator Metal Alloy Mechanical Arm Clamp Claw Kit MG996R](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/32831130256.html "6 DOF Robot Manipulator Metal Alloy Mechanical Arm Clamp Claw Kit MG996R") kit. 

Follow the robotic arm instructions to set up your arm, we will use three of the servos. The UP2 has 3 PWM pins which will allow us to control the three servos. 

Connect a wire to pin 2 of the UP2, this is the 5v output. Next connect the wire to the second power rail of your UP2. Using another wire connect the two ground rails together. This will mean on one power rail you have 3v powering your LEDs, and the second power rail provides 5v for the servos.

![Robotic Arm](../../../../Media/Images/arm-complete.jpg)

Once your arm is complete, we will use the 1st, 3rd and 6th servos. This will allow for us to pan the arm left and right, move the gripper up and down, and open and close the gripper. 

![Robotic Arm](../../../../Media/Images/arm-servo-wires.jpg)

Using male to male jumper wires, connect each of the three servos to the breadboard. To do this add wires from pins 32, 16 and 33, the three PWM pins, and connect them to your bread board. Connect the orange wire from the first servo to the wire from pin 32, the orange wire from servo 3 to pin 16, and the final orange wire from servo 6 (the gripper) to pin 33 (This pin is currently not working on the board used in this tutorial. Then connect the red wires to the 5v rail, and the brown wires to the ground rail.

# Start the system
To start the system, make sure you are in the **EMAR-Mini/Devices/2** directory and use the following commands: 

```
sudo python3 EMAR.py
```

If everything has been done correctly you will now be streaming the video frames from the EP-DCOV2735-F36.
